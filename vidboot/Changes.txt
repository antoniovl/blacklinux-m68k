040998:
 - Added hgen.

041298:
 - Moved the machine configuration to a sepparate file (main_setup.c).
 - console_scroll() rewritten, it now works.
 - Decided to keep string*() funcions despite NeXT's compiler warnings.
 - Moved switch from console_putc to console_init (faster char plot).

042098:
 - Updated Makefile and added config/*.sh to build in either Linux/NeXT.
 - Asm code standarization (see asm-setup.h).
 - A copy of simpkern and floppy headers are included. This it's used to
   build mach-o executables from Linux.
 - Slight change to simpkern.c to be able to compile in NeXT environment.
 - Now builds sepparate images to be netbooted and floppy-booted (see 
  "make net" and "make floppy").
 - Added an "make net-elf" option, that builds an elf image of vid.boot.
   This will allow disassembling it when working with Linux boxes.
 - Code corrections, placing variables outside .h and in correct places.

042198:
 - The tar file is not built from the Makefile anymore. Now you can execute
   pack.sh.

042698:
 - Minor changes to Makefile.
 - Deleted many unuseful code from main.c

062498:
 - Now we know where to get the PROM structure.
 - Added console_get* functions. Now things will be easier.
 - Slot_id value now is taken from mon_global.
 - Added CDEBUGFLAGS and ASMDEBUGFLAGS in makefile.
 - Added console_putnum10() to allow printing of decimal numbers 
   (*really ugly*, but it works for me).
 - Fixed some compiler warnings in console.c
 - Added support to bzip2 into pack.sh.

062598:
 - Changing foreground/background colors of fonts to white/black revealed
   several bugs in console_clear(), and I think that it will work even in
   NeXTdimension Boards.
 - There is a lot of work to be done with console_plotpixel to allow color
   plotting. Unfortunately, I only have mono machines. The original
   algorithm only wanted white/black plots (It worked fine for Randy to
   debug head.S).
