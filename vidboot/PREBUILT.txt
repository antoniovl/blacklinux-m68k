Prebuilt Images
---------------

   Unless I forget to build them :-), You'll find 4 prebuilt images.
   a) To be used with monochome display machines:
	- vid.boot.mono.net (result of 'make net')
	- vid.boot.mono.floppy (result of 'make floppy')
   b) To be used with color display machines
	- vid.boot.color.net
	- vid.boot.color.floppy 

   To do a quick start, you can easily dump vid.boot.*.floppy as:

	dd if=./vid.boot.mono.floppy of=/dev/fd0 

   Also, if you have a working NeXTstep, you can do:

	disk -B ./vid.boot.mono.net /dev/rfd0a

   Please be aware that *.floppy are built ready to be dumped 'as is' into the
floppy, and *.net *must* be written into the floppy's boot block with the
'disk' utility.

Enjoy.
